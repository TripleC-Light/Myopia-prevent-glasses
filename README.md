## What is Myopia Prevent Glasses?
This glasses can prevent children’s myopia getting worse,
it was tested by 4 persons, and I’m improving it now,
I integrated circuit, MCU and battery inside the frame of glasses,
so it looks just like a normal glasses.
This glasses will deliver warning when you are too close to something,
it used laser to detect distance, so this glasses will know the distance between eyes and something you are watching,
if the distance is too close, it will alert user to keep proper distance.
